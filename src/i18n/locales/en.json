    "detailedBio": [
      "My name is Cao Huu Nhan, currently a final-year Software Engineering student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HUTECH). I am on the journey of completing my final university years and preparing to enter my career path as a Developer Intern, focusing on Backend Web Development and modern technologies related to Web2 and Web3.",
      "My passion for technology and programming formed early, especially an interest in how backend systems operate: from data processing and API building to ensuring application security and performance. This motivated me to pursue Information Technology, where I have had the opportunity to learn and practice foundational knowledge in JavaScript, C#, TypeScript, as well as frameworks and technologies like Node.js, Express.js, ASP.NET Core, NestJS, React.js, and Next.js.",
      "Throughout my studies, I always try to balance academic results with self-study and practice through personal projects. I believe that knowledge is only truly valuable when applied in practice. Therefore, I have proactively built many projects, notably an e-commerce website with RESTful API architecture, JWT authentication, user authorization, VNPay integration, and an AI chatbot for customer support. Besides, I also participated in developing a dApp for game account traceability on the blockchain, where I had the opportunity to dive deeper into Smart Contracts, Solidity, EVM-compatible blockchains, IPFS, and decentralized wallet integration.",
      "In work and study, I always prioritize result quality over words. I have good teamwork skills, clear logical thinking, and a high sense of responsibility. In many projects, I am often trusted by members with the role of coordinating or leading the team, thanks to my ability to analyze problems, provide solutions, and support teammates to achieve common goals. I am particularly interested in the process of working together as a team to find the right and optimal direction for each technical problem.",
      "Besides time spent on programming, I also appreciate personal quiet moments to think, learn, and refresh myself. I believe that continuous learning, even when facing difficult problems, is the best way to grow in the ever-changing field of technology.",
      "At the present time, I desire to work in a young, dynamic, and supportive environment where I can continue to learn, hone my professional skills, and gradually affirm my value on the path to becoming a Backend / Fullstack Developer in the future. I am always ready to embrace new challenges because, for me: no matter how hard it is, I get it done."
